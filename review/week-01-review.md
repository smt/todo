### Week in review

This week was pretty hectic. I had extra tech lead duties, meaning I was in
charge of pre-grooming stories, approving pull requests, and presenting a demo
of our work to stakeholders at the end.

Everything went well, but somewhat at the expense of my personal goals for the
week. I didn't have the energy at the end of each day to make progress on my
reading list, and I also failed to get a blog post together, so I'll take
those things as feedback for what to focus on for this coming week.

The crowning moment of the week was unexpectedly getting to celebrate [St.
Totteringham's Day] this year. It happened again: Arsenal ended up finishing
above Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League for the 21st year in a row, as
Spurs were embarrassed 5-1 by Newcastle United. Feeling so smug right now.
