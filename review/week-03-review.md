### Week in review

This was a difficult week, in spite of being short (I had Friday off, as well
as Monday). We're entering a difficult, challenging period at work with the
project I'm on, and that has eaten up quite a bit of time. I got to spend some
extra quality time with my family over the long weekend, though.
