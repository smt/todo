## Mad Coding

-   ~~Ramda.js as gateway drug to functional programming~~
    -   Unpack this a bit further

-   Learning Haskell
    -   The lambda calculus
    -   Infix functions
    -   Type annotation
    -   Arity
    -   Datatypes
    -   Typeclass inheritance

-   Lion-tamer syndrome

    | I think a lot of new programmers like to use advanced    |
    | data structures and advanced language features as        |
    | a way of demonstrating their ability. I call it the      |
    | lion-tamer syndrome. Such demonstrations are impressive, |
    | but unless they actually translate into real wins        |
    | for the project, avoid them.                             |

-   Confirmation bias

    ```text
    *---------------------------------------------------*
    | Almost every programming language is overrated by |
    | its practitioners.                                |
